			<p>TO COMPLETE THIS PUZZLE READ THE PASSAGE CAREFULLY, THEN ENTER THE 3 DIGIT CODE AND PRESS ENTER</p>

			<p>LOG: WE TRACED THE TREASURE AND YOU MAY TOO. I PLACED THE LOCK SO ONLY SOMEONE WHO LOCATED THIS PARCHMENT
				COULD OPEN IT. OUR PATH WAS TREACHEROUS, BUT IF YOU TRACK PROPERLY YOU CAN UNLOCK THE TREASURE. BE
				CAREFUL, WE WENT AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE BUT THE ISLAND IS TRICKY.</p>

			<p>DAY 1:
				WE STARTED OUR JOURNEY AT THE GATES TO THE LARGEST CITY. FROM THERE WE TREKKED SOUTH TO A LONE
				LIGHTHOUSE. WE ACQUIRED A SHIP, AND TOOK OUR VESSEL TO A DARK ISLAND WITH A MASSIVE GOLDEN NUGGET ATOP A
				CASTLE. WE WERE CHASED OUT, BARELY ESCAPING TO A DESERTED ISLAND OF CACTUS AND SCORPION. WE CHOSE TO
				SAIL AGAIN AND CROSSED A BLACK FLAGGED SHIP. THEY ESCORTED US TO THE CLOSEST DOCK EAST OF THEM. WE
				WALKED THROUGH THE JUNGLE TO A HUMONGOUS TEMPLE OF GOLD! TOOK AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND SAILED BACK TO THE
				DARK ISLAND, BRIEFLY CROSSING PATHS WITH A RED FLAGGED SHIP. WE BOUGHT THAT GRAY CASTLE AND CALLED IT A
				DAY.</p>

			<p>DAY 2:
				WE STARTED THIS DAY FIGHTING A MASSIVE SEA SERPENT! HOW DID WE EVEN GET HERE!? NONETHELESS THE SERPENT
				WAS NO MATCH AND WE SET SAIL FOR A NEARBY GRAY ISLAND WITH PURPLE GEMS. NOT MUCH TO DO HERE SO WE SAILED
				AGAIN FOR THE WESTERN POINT OF THE BIG ISLAND WHERE A LONELY TOWER STANDS. IT WAS COMPLETELY RANSACKED,
				WE THOUGHT THE CAMP TO THE EAST MIGHT HAVE ANSWERS AND MADE OUR WAY TO THE COLLECTION OF TEEPEES. THEY
				SAID A LARGE FISH WITH SHARP TEETH HAD EATEN ALL THEIR GOLD! WE HAD TO GET IT BACK! SO WE SAILED FOR THE
				SHARP TOOTHED FISH AND HAD A BATTLE. I THINK IT WON THOUGHâ€¦</p>

			<p> 3:
				WE AWOKE TODAY ON A SMALL ISLAND NEXT TO A LARGE OCTOPUS WITH A SINGLE GRAVE. NO MATTER I TOOK MY CREW
				TO THE GILDED ANCHOR FOR PLUNDERING. AFTER PLUNDERING WE WENT HEADLONG TO FIND THE LEGENDARY GOLDEN COW
				OF GOLD! THE LOCALS BEGAN TO CHASE US AND WE ENDED UP FACE TO FACE WITH A COUPLE OF JELLYFISH. IT TOOK
				ONE OF OUR OWN SO WE DECIDED TO BURY HIM IN A GRAVE IN THE JUNGLE TO THE EAST OF THE VOLCANO. FROM THEIR
				WE MADE IT BACK TO TODAYS STARTING LOCATION, BUT THE OCTOPUS DESTROYED OUR SHIP ATE MOST OF MY CREW, AND
				LEFT ME TO PERISH.
